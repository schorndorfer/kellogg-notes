HISTORY:
TRAUMA, ASSESS FOR HEMORRHAGE
REPORT
HISTORY: As above.
COMPARISON: No relevant prior examinations available.
TECHNIQUE: Head CT without contrast.
FINDINGS:
There is a predominantly hyperdense extra axial collection layering over the left cerebral
convexity and left tentorium, consistent with a subdural hematoma. The component overlying the
left cerebral convexity measures 11-mm and the tentorial component measures 15-mm.
There is associated mass effect with effacement of the adjacent left cerebral sulci and left lateral
ventricle and 6-mm of rightward midline shift. There is mild subfalcine herniation. There is no
uncal herniation. There is also a small amount of subdural hemorrhage along the falx and right
tentorium.
There is hypodensity in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, a nonspecific finding
that is often seen in patients with microangiopathic changes. The brain parenchyma is otherwise
unremarkable. There is no evidence of intracranial mass lesion, acute infarction.
There is scattered mucosal thickening of the paranasal sinuses. The bilateral mastoid air cells are
well aerated and clear. A prosthesis is noted in the right globe.
There is a large posterior subgaleal hematoma. No fracture is identified.
IMPRESSION:
Predominantly hyperdense subdural hematoma layering over the left cerebral convexity and left
tentorium, measuring up to 15 mm in greatest diameter. There is also a small amount of
subdural hemorrhage along the right tentorium and the falx. There is associated mass effect with
6-mm of rightward midline shift and mild subfalcine herniation.
Nonspecific white matter hypoattenuation, likely representing microangiopathic changes.
